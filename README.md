A prototype to see if we can fine-tune an LLM into a style guide editor.

## Disclaimers & disclosures

I (Kayce Basques) created this repository as a personal experiment. I work for Google,
but I did not seek out Google's approval to open source this project and work on it
publicly. Therefore this repository is not a Google product "in any way, shape, or form."
However, due to the terms of my employment with Google, you should assume that Google
could assert ownership over this repository if it wanted to.

Also, hopefully it goes without saying, but just to be safe: if anything goes
wrong, then it's obviously 100% my fault and 0% Google's fault since I didn't seek
out Google's approval to work on this.

If any of this might be a problem for you, then please do not use this code or
contribute to this repository!
